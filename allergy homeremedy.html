<h4>Apple Cider vinegar (ACV)</h4>

<p>This is definitely our first choice. 
Boosting your immune system is the single most important thing you can do to successfully treat and cure your allergies.</p> 
<ul><li>ACV is a very powerful gut healer and immune booster. 
<li>It also helps to promote the growth of “friendly” bacteria (probiotics) in the gut, 
which is another excellent home remedy for all types of allergies</ul>

<h4>Good Bacteria (Probiotics)</h4>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.extrachai.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lacto-s5-img1.jpg?resize=775%2C708&ssl=1" alt="">
<p>This remedy follows on from apple cider vinegar. 
As you now know, probiotics are essential for gut health and immune health.
 Without enough beneficial bacteria growing and thriving in the digestive system,
 the bad (and the very bad) bacteria take over and intoxicate your body.</p>
<ul><li>So if you regularly suffer from allergies such as hay fever then there’s a pretty good chance that you also get sick often (as a result of your low immunity).
<li> But when you take in enough of the good bacteria, they quickly go to work and kill off these harmful organisms then take up residence themselves in the gut.</ul>

<ul><li>Mix together 4 tbsp. of baking soda and 12 tbsp. of distilled water until it forms a paste.
<li>Apply the paste to the itchy area.
<li>After 10 minutes, gently rinse the area with cool water.</ul>

<ul><li>You can use coconut oil daily on even the most sensitive parts of your body. These include the area underneath your eyes and around your mouth.
<li>Another advantage of coconut oil is that you don’t need to mix it with anything. Coconut is gentle enough for substantial everyday use.</ul>
